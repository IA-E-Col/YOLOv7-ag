Page Currently Under Construction. 

We are actively preparing detailed content, including comprehensive instructions for training and testing our model. 
Additionally, we will provide thorough examples on how to use the model for extracting detected plant organs and organizing them into separate folders. 
This will facilitate their use in subsequent models. 

Thank you for your patience. We will publish the content very soon.
